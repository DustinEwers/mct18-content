Thank you for your interest in my talk!

This presentation is a tale of my personal journey to become more productive. As life, work, and other things started to pile up I realized I was saying "I'm sorry, I forgot" more than I needed to. 

This presentation gives you a lot of things I researched and read about as I started hacking myself to be more productive. There are necessary things you can begin applying immediately, and there is the methodology called "Getting Things Done" that I've adapted to work with mobile/desktop apps like Todoist which is always with you digitally. While you won't get to see precisely how I manage everything in my personal Todoist app (since there is no demo), I am readily available via email or twitter should you have any questions. 

Thank you,
